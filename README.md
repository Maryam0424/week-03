TASK 1
Task 1 involves developing a program to record milk yields for a herd of cows over a week. It defines a function called `record_yield()` responsible for storing milk yield data for each cow, with parameters including cow identity code, milk yield amount, and the day of the week. The program organizes this data in a dictionary structure, using each cow's identity code as a key and a nested dictionary to represent yields for each day of the week. Through user input, the main function collects milk yield data for each cow for all seven days of the week, utilizing the `record_yield()` function. The program's structured approach facilitates accurate data management and analysis of milk production trends within the herd. Adjustments to recorded data can be made to reflect real-world scenarios before analyzing the data further.
TASK 2
Task 2 builds upon the recorded milk yield data from Task 1 to calculate key statistics and identify patterns in milk production. It calculates the total weekly volume of milk for the entire herd and the average yield per cow for the week using recorded data. Additionally, it identifies the most productive cow based on total weekly yield and cows with low milk yields, specifically those producing less than 12 liters for four or more days in the week. The program displays these findings, providing valuable insights into milk production trends within the herd. Adjustments to recorded data can be made to reflect real-world scenarios before running the program.
TASK 3
Task 3 extends Task 2 to identify and display the most productive cow and cows with a low volume of milk. It defines a function called `identify_cows()` responsible for this task, which iterates through recorded milk yield data to calculate total weekly yield and count low yield days for each cow. The function then identifies the most productive cow based on total weekly yield and any cows with a low volume of milk for four or more days. The main function calls `identify_cows()` to obtain these results and displays them, including the identity code number and weekly yield of the most productive cow, as well as identity code numbers and weekly yields of cows with low milk volume. Adjustments to recorded data can be made before running the program to reflect actual milk yields of the cows.
